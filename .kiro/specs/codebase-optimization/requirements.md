# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the existing Reddit Karma Tracker codebase to improve code readability, maintainability, and extensibility. The optimization will address code organization, type safety, error handling, performance, testing infrastructure, and development experience while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Organization and Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns, so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the project SHALL have a clear layered architecture with distinct separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers
2. WHEN looking at file organization THEN components SHALL be organized by feature/domain rather than by technical type
3. WHEN reviewing imports THEN there SHALL be consistent import ordering and barrel exports for cleaner imports
4. WHEN examining business logic THEN it SHALL be extracted from React components into dedicated service classes or custom hooks
5. WHEN reviewing API routes THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns with proper middleware and validation

### Requirement 2: Type Safety and Code Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive type safety and code quality tools, so that I can catch errors early and maintain consistent code standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN TypeScript SHALL be configured with strict mode and comprehensive type checking
2. WHEN defining data structures THEN all API responses, database models, and component props SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces
3. WHEN handling external data THEN runtime validation SHALL be implemented using schema validation libraries
4. WHEN writing code THEN ESLint and Prettier SHALL be configured with comprehensive rules for code consistency
5. WHEN committing code THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL enforce code quality standards

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues in development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently across all layers of the application
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN users SHALL receive meaningful error messages with appropriate fallback UI
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate context and severity levels
4. WHEN handling async operations THEN proper error boundaries SHALL be implemented for React components
5. WHEN debugging THEN structured logging SHALL provide clear information about application state and operations

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and respond smoothly, so that I can efficiently track Reddit karma without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the application THEN components SHALL implement proper loading states and skeleton screens
2. WHEN fetching data THEN API calls SHALL be optimized with caching, debouncing, and request deduplication
3. WHEN rendering charts THEN large datasets SHALL be handled efficiently with virtualization or pagination
4. WHEN navigating the app THEN React components SHALL use proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
5. WHEN building the application THEN bundle size SHALL be optimized with code splitting and tree shaking

### Requirement 5: Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing components THEN unit tests SHALL cover all major functionality and edge cases
2. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN integration tests SHALL verify proper request/response handling
3. WHEN implementing business logic THEN service layer tests SHALL validate core functionality
4. WHEN testing user interactions THEN end-to-end tests SHALL cover critical user workflows
5. WHEN running tests THEN coverage reports SHALL indicate at least 80% code coverage

### Requirement 6: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want excellent development tooling and documentation, so that I can work efficiently and onboard new team members easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN development environment SHALL be easily reproducible with clear setup instructions
2. WHEN writing code THEN IDE integration SHALL provide excellent TypeScript support with auto-completion and error detection
3. WHEN debugging THEN development tools SHALL provide clear insights into application state and performance
4. WHEN contributing THEN code documentation SHALL explain complex business logic and architectural decisions
5. WHEN onboarding THEN README and inline documentation SHALL provide clear guidance for new developers

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized and type-safe configuration management, so that I can easily manage different environments and feature flags.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN environment variables SHALL be validated and type-safe
2. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN configuration SHALL be easily manageable without code changes
3. WHEN adding new features THEN feature flags SHALL be supported for gradual rollouts
4. WHEN managing secrets THEN sensitive configuration SHALL be properly secured and not exposed to the client
5. WHEN debugging configuration THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate missing or invalid configuration values

### Requirement 8: Data Layer Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an optimized data layer with proper abstractions, so that I can easily work with data without worrying about implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing data THEN repository pattern SHALL provide clean abstractions over database operations
2. WHEN caching data THEN intelligent caching strategies SHALL reduce unnecessary API calls and database queries
3. WHEN handling data transformations THEN dedicated mapper functions SHALL convert between different data formats
4. WHEN validating data THEN schema validation SHALL ensure data integrity at boundaries
5. WHEN querying data THEN optimized queries SHALL minimize database load and response times
