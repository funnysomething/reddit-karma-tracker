# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Reddit Karma Tracker is a web application that monitors and visualizes the karma and post count history for a collection of Reddit users. The system will track these metrics over time and present them through interactive graphs, allowing users to view individual user statistics or combined analytics. The application will be hosted using free services (Vercel for hosting, Supabase for database) to minimize operational costs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add Reddit usernames to track, so that I can monitor their karma and post activity over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid Reddit username THEN the system SHALL add the username to the tracking list
2. WHEN a user enters an invalid Reddit username THEN the system SHALL display an error message and not add the username
3. WHEN a user attempts to add a duplicate username THEN the system SHALL prevent the addition and notify the user
4. IF the tracking list is empty THEN the system SHALL display a prompt to add usernames

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view historical karma and post count data for tracked users, so that I can analyze their Reddit activity trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a tracked username THEN the system SHALL display a graph showing karma history over time
2. WHEN a user selects a tracked username THEN the system SHALL display a graph showing post count history over time
3. WHEN historical data is available THEN the system SHALL show data points for at least the last 30 days
4. IF no historical data exists for a user THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating data collection is in progress

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view combined analytics for all tracked users, so that I can compare performance across multiple Reddit accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects the combined view option THEN the system SHALL display overlaid graphs for all tracked users
2. WHEN viewing combined analytics THEN the system SHALL use different colors or styles to distinguish between users
3. WHEN viewing combined analytics THEN the system SHALL include a legend identifying each user
4. IF only one user is being tracked THEN the system SHALL disable the combined view option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to automatically collect Reddit data at regular intervals, so that historical tracking is maintained without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs its scheduled data collection THEN it SHALL fetch current karma and post counts for all tracked users
2. WHEN data collection occurs THEN the system SHALL store the data with a timestamp in the database
3. WHEN the Reddit API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL retry the request up to 3 times before logging an error
4. IF a tracked user account is deleted or suspended THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and continue tracking other users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to remove users from tracking, so that I can manage my tracking list and remove accounts I'm no longer interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a tracked username for removal THEN the system SHALL remove the user from the tracking list
2. WHEN a user is removed from tracking THEN the system SHALL retain their historical data for potential future re-adding
3. WHEN a user confirms removal THEN the system SHALL update the display to reflect the change immediately
4. IF the user is the last tracked account THEN the system SHALL display the empty state prompt

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to be responsive and fast, so that I can access it effectively from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads THEN it SHALL be fully functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN a user interacts with graphs THEN the response time SHALL be under 2 seconds
3. WHEN the page loads initially THEN it SHALL display content within 3 seconds
4. IF the user is on a slow connection THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators for long-running operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use free hosting services, so that operational costs are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL use Vercel for web hosting
2. WHEN the application stores data THEN it SHALL use Supabase free tier for database services
3. WHEN accessing Reddit data THEN the system SHALL use Reddit's free API within rate limits
4. IF usage exceeds free tier limits THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the limitations and notify users appropriately
